"""Property tests for ``BaseGandiClient._request`` retry policy (closes #34).

Invariant: a timeout during a non-idempotent method (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
is NEVER retried. Retrying could double-execute a purchase, a DNS record
mutation, a mailbox delete, etc. Idempotent methods (GET, HEAD) MAY retry on
timeout.

The property is checked against the full set of HTTP methods. The client's
retry decorator is wired with method-conditional ``retry_on`` — this test
pins that wiring statically by injecting a fault and counting calls.

``asyncio.sleep`` is patched to a no-op so tenacity's exponential backoff
between retries doesn't blow the property-suite's <5 s runtime budget.
