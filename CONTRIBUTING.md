Thanks for contributing to gandi-mcp!

## Branch protection

The `main` branch requires:
- Pull request before merge
- Status checks: `static`, `test (3.13)`, `audit`
- Linear history (no merge commits)
- No force-push

Configure in GitHub Settings -> Branches -> "Add branch protection rule" for `main`.

## Local development

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Test tiers

| Tier | Command | Network | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit + mocked + contract | `uv run pytest -m "not live"` | None | Default; runs in CI |
| Live (read-only) | `GANDI_TOKEN=$PAT uv run pytest -m live` | Real Gandi | See `tests/integration/test_live_smoke.py` |
| Smoke (release gate) | `GANDI_TOKEN=$PAT uv run pytest -m smoke` | Real Gandi | Subset of `live`; see `tests/integration/` |

### Recording contract cassettes

Tier-3 contract tests under `tests/contract/` replay YAML cassettes recorded
against `api.gandi.net`. CI never hits the live API; replay-only.

**To re-record after a Gandi API change:**

1. Create a sandbox Personal Access Token at https://account.gandi.net/, scoped
   **only** to the `teamrocket.network` test domain. Do not use a full-account
   PAT; the cassettes will contain less-redacted data and a leak would be more
   damaging.
2. Store the PAT in your password manager (`pass insert gandi/pat-sandbox` or
   equivalent). Never commit it.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   GANDI_TOKEN=$(pass show gandi/pat-sandbox) make refresh-cassettes
   ```
   The target stages new cassettes under `tests/contract/cassettes.new/` and
   only swaps them in on full success.
4. Review the diff:
   ```bash
   git diff -- tests/contract/cassettes/
   ```
   Scan for any unredacted PII (real email addresses, IBANs, customer UUIDs
   outside the redacted JSON paths). If you spot any, extend
   `tests/contract/_redact.py`'s `PII_JSON_PATHS` rather than hand-editing the
   cassette.
5. Commit the cassette diff in its own commit so reviewers can focus on it.

**Stale cassettes.** `make check-cassettes-fresh` fails if any cassette is
older than 180 days. CI runs this as a non-blocking warning. Plan to refresh
quarterly, or whenever a contract test fails on a field shape change.

**What gets redacted.**
`filter_headers` strips the `Authorization` bearer token and any cookies.
`filter_query_parameters` strips the `sharing_id` URL parameter.
The JSON-path response redactor (`tests/contract/_redact.py`) scrubs the
following keys: `customer.id`, `owner.id`, `registrant.email`,
`registrant.phone`, `registrant.streetaddr`, `billing.iban`. Other UUIDs
(DNS record IDs, mailbox IDs, the resource's own `id`) survive; tests may
assert against them.

### Detecting cassette drift

Cassettes pin response shape (keys + types + cardinality bounds) but don't
detect when Gandi silently renames or restructures fields between refreshes.
`make check-drift` records new cassettes against `teamrocket.network`,
diffs them structurally against the committed tree, and reports any
additions / removals / type changes / cardinality shifts.

**To run locally:**

```bash
GANDI_TOKEN=$(pass show gandi/pat-sandbox) make check-drift
```

Exits 0 on no drift, 1 on drift detected (with a report on stdout), 2 on
invalid input or missing token. The freshly-recorded cassettes stay in
`tests/contract/cassettes.new/`; they are never automatically swapped
into place. If the drift is real and accepted, run `make refresh-cassettes`
to update the committed tree.

**To run in CI:**

The `drift-check` workflow under `.github/workflows/drift-check.yml` is
dispatch-only (no cron). Trigger it from the Actions tab. On detected
drift the workflow opens or appends to a `drift`-labeled issue via the
project's `GANDI_SANDBOX_PAT` secret. Required:

- Repo secret `GANDI_SANDBOX_PAT` set to a PAT scoped to `teamrocket.network`.
- Repo label `drift` exists.

**What counts as drift?**

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `+ added <path> (<type>)` | New key Gandi started returning. |
| `- removed <path> (<type>)` | Key Gandi stopped returning. |
| `~ <path>: <old> → <new>` | Value type changed (e.g. `str → int`). |
| `! list <path>: m..n → p..q` | List cardinality bounds shifted. |
| `~ union <path>: ...` | A heterogeneous list's member-type set changed. |

Warnings (stderr) cover non-comparable interactions (non-JSON bodies,
missing-on-new files, orchestration changes from the test suite itself);
these do not fail the gate.

### Code style

- `ruff format` formats; `ruff check` lints
- `uv run ty check src/gandi_mcp/` for type checking
- Run `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` before committing

### Commits

- Imperative mood, <=72 char subject line
- One logical change per commit
- Co-author tag for AI-assisted contributions

## Mutation testing (local)

We use [mutmut](https://mutmut.readthedocs.io/) to verify the unit test suite catches semantic bugs, not just line execution. Mutation testing intentionally introduces small code changes ("mutants"). If the test suite still passes against the mutated code, that mutant **survived** and points to a test gap.

Mutation testing is **local only**; it's too slow for CI. The configuration in `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.mutmut]`) scopes mutation to the four highest-value modules:

- `src/gandi_mcp/clients/base.py`: request plumbing, retry policy, error mapping
- `src/gandi_mcp/errors.py`: exception hierarchy + `handle_client_error`
- `src/gandi_mcp/server.py`: lifespan, visibility gating, mode/purchase plumbing
- `src/gandi_mcp/tools/_common.py`: runtime safety-gate asserts

### Running

```bash
# Full baseline (~15-30 s on a developer laptop)
uv run mutmut run

# Inspect the per-mutant outcome list
uv run mutmut results

# Show the diff for a specific surviving mutant
uv run mutmut show gandi_mcp.clients.base.xǁBaseGandiClientǁ_parse_json__mutmut_5
```

`mutmut` mirrors the source tree to `mutants/` (gitignored), patches one mutant at a time, and reruns `pytest tests/unit/`. A surviving mutant is one where every unit test still passed despite the mutation.

### Interpreting results

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🎉 killed | A test failed when the mutant was patched in; the test suite catches this class of bug. |
| 🙁 survived | All tests passed with the mutant; likely a test gap or an equivalent (no-op) mutant. |
| 🫥 no_tests | No test exercised this code path; either dead code or missing coverage. |
| ⏰ timeout | The mutant induced an infinite loop / hang; treat as a kill. |
| 🤔 suspicious | Test infrastructure failed for reasons unrelated to the mutation. Re-run before drawing a conclusion. |

### Killing surviving mutants

For each survivor, ask:

1. **Is the mutation behaviorally equivalent?** (e.g. `+= 0`, reordering independent statements, replacing `max(0, x)` with `max(x, 0)` when both branches are unreachable.) Document as equivalent and move on.
2. **Does it expose a real test gap?** Add a focused unit test that fails against the mutant. Prefer asserting the specific behavior; extending an existing test with another `assert` is often enough.
3. **Is the surviving code dead?** Delete it.

### Equivalent mutants

Survivors documented here are behaviourally equivalent to the original source; no test can kill them without inspecting the bytecode itself. Listed so reviewers don't waste a turn re-investigating each baseline.

`clients/base.py`:

- `__init____mutmut_1` (`timeout: int = 30` -> `timeout: int = 31`) and `__init____mutmut_2` (`max_retries: int = 3` -> `max_retries: int = 4`): mutmut's trampoline rewrites `__init__` to forward `kwargs={'timeout': timeout, 'max_retries': max_retries, ...}` from the *outer* `__init__` signature into the mutant function. The outer defaults (30 / 3) are baked into the wrapper, so the mutant function's own default value is never used. No call site that goes through `BaseGandiClient(...)` can observe the mutated default; architecturally equivalent under mutmut, not a real test gap.
- `_parse_json__mutmut_12`: drops `status_code=None` from the invalid-JSON `GandiError(...)` call. The default value of `status_code` on `GandiError.__init__` is already `None`, so passing it explicitly versus omitting it produces the same exception state.
- `get__mutmut_8` / `post__mutmut_8` / `put__mutmut_8` / `patch__mutmut_8` / `delete__mutmut_8`: change the literal method string from upper-case (`"GET"`) to lower-case (`"get"`). The string passes through three normalisers before it can be observed: `_request` does `method.upper() in ("GET", "HEAD")` for the retry-class decision, `httpx.Request` upper-cases `method` before sending, and `GandiTimeoutError.__init__` upper-cases the `method` it stores on the exception. Every observable surface (wire-method, retry policy, timeout-error string) is identical for `"GET"` and `"get"`.

### Current baseline (2026-05-12)

| Module | Mutants | Survived | No-tests | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `clients/base.py` | (large) | 59 | 0 | Most survivors are `__init__` defaults and `_request` retry-config branches; tests assert behavior, not constructor internals. |
| `errors.py` | 42 | 0 | 0 | 100 % kill rate. Every `handle_client_error` message substring + every typed-exception `__init__` is pinned. |
| `server.py` | 58 | 0 | 0 | 100 % kill rate. The three former `create_server` lifespan-wiring survivors (`lifespan=None`, `lifespan=_build_lifespan(None)`, kwarg removed) are now pinned via `TestCreateServerLifespanWiring` in `tests/unit/test_server_messages.py`. |
| `tools/_common.py` | 18 | 0 | 0 | 100 % kill rate. The two message-string survivors in `assert_readwrite` / `assert_purchases_allowed` are now pinned via `test_error_message_is_canonical` (exact-equality on the full f-string) in `tests/unit/test_tools_common.py`. |
| **Total** | **306** | **59** | **0** | **80.7 % kill rate overall.** |

Open follow-ups (kill remaining survivors on a per-module basis):

- #83: `clients/base.py` survivors

CI integration of mutation testing is deferred; runs take long enough that gating on them would slow PRs significantly.
